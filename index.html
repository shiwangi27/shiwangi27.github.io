    	<p><h3>About the design</h3></p>
    	<p><i style="color:blue">Sequence of Actions</i><p>
    	<p>
    		Go to the shower, open the shower curtain. If you want to take a bath, press the diverter down if it's up for the water to fill before which you need to make sure if the water temperature is precisely what you desire by rotating the handle. You would want to press the button at the bottom of the tub so that it fills up for a comfortable hot (or warm) bath.  
			<br>
			<br>
			If you want to take a shower, pull the diverter up if it's down and then control the water temperature for a good shower. In this design, you can control the water temperature by rotating the handle. You might also want to adjust the shower head for the reach or angle you want to take shower in. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Lastly you would rotate the handle to stop the water from running once you are done with the shower and also press the button for it close open up the sink to empty the water in the tub.

    	<p><i style="color:blue">Common and rare uses</i></p>
    	<p> 
    		<b>Common Uses: </b> To take shower or bath, bathe your child  </br>
			<b>Rare Uses: </b> Wash pets, wash plants, wash rags, clean wounds </br>
    	</p>


		<p><i style="color:blue">Directions to the User</i></p>
		<p> 
			This design helps user control the handle, Turn on and Turn off water by indicating a rotate mark in blue/red. <br>
			The blue/red mark also indicates that you want hot water (red) or cold water (blue). The progressively increasing width of the mark means you control the flow of water whether you need less flow/more flow. <br>
			The diverter helps user by creating a mapping between showerhead and tap. A diverter pull or push will indicate showerhead active or tap active respectively. 


    	</p>


		<p><i style="color:blue">State of the System</i></p>
		<p> 
			A no water flow state means that the control handle at the bottom where there are no red/blue markers. <br>
			Pulled-up diverter means your shower will start when handle is rotated and pulled-down means your tap will run when handle is rotated. <br>
			The button at the bottom if it’s lifted indicated the water will flow and if it’s pressed then the water will fill the tub. 

    	</p>


		<p><i style="color:blue">Ease of use to the guests </i></p>
		<p> 
			It probably is good for the guests to figure out how to start shower/bath. But the temperature control and the way to start hot or cold water is a little tricky.

    	</p>


		<p><i style="color:blue">Good and bad aspects of the Design</i></p>
			Good Aspects: It is easier for the guest to see that the handle needs to be rotated so that the water starts running rather than they have to pull a knob and then rotate and adjust that temperature. You don’t want to stand in the shower and then pull the knob to get freezing cold or ultra hot water. That way this indicates things pretty nicely. Also, you can just press the button down or up to fill the tub or not. In some designs that would be so difficult to figure that out.<br><br>
			Bad Aspects: The temperature control is bad in a way that the water temperature has to increase until it reaches the maximum and then it goes towards hotter temperature. The handle just rotates one way.
